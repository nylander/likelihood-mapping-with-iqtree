## Installation

The script is written in bash, and requires `iqtree2` to be installed.
The full path to `iqtree2` can changed directly in the script (line 14) if needed.

In order to utilize all functionality of the provided `Makefile`, GNU make and
GNU parallel needs to be installed.

If `make` is installed, the script can be installed (in `/usr/local/bin`) by using

    $ make install

To install in another location, e.g., `$HOME/bin`, use

    $ make PREFIX=$HOME install
